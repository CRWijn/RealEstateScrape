# RealEstateScrape
At the time of creating this project I was looking to move but was struggling to react to listings on time. With this script I was hoping to be able to get notified at new listings faster and up my chances of getting a viewing.

To run this script you need to use Selenium and chrome (so also have chrome drivers). You also need the fake-useragent package and a telegram account and bot setup.
If something strange happens during running or it's not working properly please look at the checks.log. 

IMPORTANT!
You need to create a credentials.txt file with the first line your telegram ID and the second line your telegram bot token. The script will push a message saying this file does not exist to the checks.log.
